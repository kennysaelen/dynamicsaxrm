## Synopsis
ReleaseManagment for Dynamics AX 2012 is the bridge between ReleaseManagement For Visual Studio 2013 (http://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/products/release-management-for-microsoft-visual-studio-vs.aspx) and Dynamics AX 2012. The project contains the scripts that you will need to configure ReleaseManagement to perform various actions regarding to the deployment of builds to Dynamics AX Environments.

The solution consists of:
A PowerShell module containing a library of functions to get things dons within your Dynamics AX Environment
Wrapper PowerShell scripts representing tools within ReleaseManagement

Note: The scripts depend the CodeCrib dll files of the Dynamics AX Admin project on CodePlex. There are dll's in the source here, but for the latest version, check on https://dynamicsaxadmin.codeplex.com/
